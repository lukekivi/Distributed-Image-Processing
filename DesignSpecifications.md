## Architecture Overview
There is a **ImageProcessingClient** who sends jobs to an **ImageProcessingServer**. The server has access to *n* **ImageProcessingNode**s. The server then logically divides the job and attempts to divide the work into tasks which are assigned to the population of available nodes. The nodes who receive jobs then carry out a filtering task on some portion of the overall data. The nodes respond to the server with a success status. Once each task is completed the server gives returns a success status to the client. The entire process is synchronous.

Data is stored in some shared memory space and is not transferred via the socket. Instead, file locations are passed for jobs and tasks.

&nbsp; 
## ImageProcessingClient

The **ImageProcessingClient** runs with a config file that contains information about the shared memory space and the machine hosting the **ImageProcessingServer**. It also has takes a directory of images as an argument. The client then makes a request to the **ImageProcessingServer** and eventually gets a **JobReceipt** confirming the work has been completed as expected.

The key jobs are:
- Send **JobRequest**s to **ImageProcessingServer**
- Receive **JobReceipt** from **ImageProcessingServer**

&nbsp; 
## ImageProcessingServer
The **ImageProcessingServer** receives a **JobRequest** from the **ImageProcessingClient**. It then logically divides the job into **TaskRequest**s and sends those out to **ImageProcessingNode**s and then awaits a **TaskReceipt**. The server starts a thread to communicate with each node. When a response is received the server must review it. If the task was accepted and completed it updates the main **TaskReceipt** and waits for other nodes to respond. If the task was rejected then the server must make another request with a newly chosen node. Once the main **TaskReceipt** is completed it is sent back to the **ImageProcessingClient**.

The key jobs are:
- Receive **JobRequest**s from **ImageProcessingClient**
- Divide labor amongst **ImageProcessingNode**s
- Manage **TaskReceipt**'s returned by **ImageProcessingNode**s
- Return a main **JobReceipt** to the **ImageProcessingClient**

&nbsp; 
## ImageProcessingNodes
The **ImageProcessingNode**s receives a **TaskRequest** from the **ImageProcessingServer** and they set their current load percentages and **SchedulingPolicy**s via a local configuration file. The node should then look at its **SchedulingPolicy** and ff the policy is **Mandatory** the node must accept the job. If the policy is **Optional** the node then rejects the task with a probability equal to its current load percentage. If the task is accepted it then starts a thread to process the images specified in that description. The node accesses shared memory in order to get the image data it needs. Anynode may be processing multiple **TaskRequest**s simultaniouslyâ€”one per thread. Upon completing a **TaskRequest** the node returns a **TaskReceipt** to the **ImageProcessingServer** indicating its successful completion or rejection.

The key jobs are:
- Receive **TaskRequest**s from **ImageProcessingServer**
- Process images
- Send **TaskReceipt** to **ImageProcessingServer**

#### Note
For the sake of school we will be implementing an explicit *load percentage* parameter instead of a true *load balance*. This will allow the ImageProcessingNodes to behave as if they are truly experiencing variable load thus allowing us to test our load balancing technique of rejection by probability. Also, nodes will have a probability of adding a delay proportional to the *load percentage* parameter. So for each accepted job there will be a probability of a constant three second delay prior to that job being processed.

## JobRequest
A **JobRequest** identifies what work needs to be done via a directory path. This is passed from the **ImageProcessingClient** to the **ImageProcessingServer** to identify which data should be processed. 

&nbsp; 
## JobReceipt
A **JobReceipt** contains a **JobStatus** value representing whether or not the job was completed. **JobReceipt**s are returned by the **ImageProcessingServer** to the **ImageProcessingClient**. A job can fail or succeed.

&nbsp;
## TaskRequest
A **TaskRequest** is an order for the **ImageProcessingNode** to process an image. The particular image is identified by a path in the request.

&nbsp;
## TaskReceipt
A **TaskReceipt** contains a **TaskStatus**representing the completion status of the task designated to a particular node. It can be successful, fail, or be rejected.

&nbsp; 
## Scheduling Policies
There are two scheduling policies:
1. **Mandatory**: the server chooses nodes at random for jobs and they are mandatorilly accepted.
2. **Optional**: the server chooses nodes at random for jobs and they are optionally accepted. If they are rejected the server continues to search for a node to accept the job.
